# Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Schal and I'm a student currently working on my masters degree in IT and business. 

I'm trying to get into software development and am looking to collaborate in a few projects to learn a bit more about software and also to give back to the community as I'm an avid open source user myself.

My main focus currently is on learning Python, but who knows what other languages may spark my interest.

I'm very proficient in SQL, especially Oracle SQL and have some very basic skills in Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
